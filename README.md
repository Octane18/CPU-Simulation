Download the latest available logisim software from http://www.cburch.com/logisim/download.html and then clone the .circ file present in this repositiry and open it with the downloaded logisim software. You also need to clone the pdf file.

To actually run instructions, there is a need to understand what kind of format has been used for the instructions which is present in the pdf given in the repository. As this was a project, it is the answersheet of our project but it contains all the needed details to understand how to write specific instructions. Those instructions need to be entered in the program counter that has been labelled in the .circ file. It is recommended to firstly have a basic understanding of how Logisim works before trying to directly test the functionality of the processor on logisim.
